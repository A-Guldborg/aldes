# Counter-example

1) Give a counter-example to sale and specify what a greedy suboptimal solution could find and what the optimal solution is for the counter-example  

# Greedy

1) Which one?  
pipprice  

2) Describe the algorithm, e.g. using pseudocode.  
```python
T, k = read from input
tiles = read from input
i = 0
while i < T and k - (tiles[i].a + tiles[i].b) >= 0:
    i = i + 1
    k = k - (tiles[i].a + tiles[i].b)

print(i)
```

In other words, sort the tiles based on their total number of pips (`a + b`) increasingly, and then deduct their total number of pips from `k` while there are tiles left and `k - (a_i + b_i) >= 0`. Then the result will be `i`.

3) Running time in terms of input parameters.  
This solution's most heavy operation is sorting which can be done by a number of sorting algorithms with time complexity `O(T log T)`.

# Graph traversal

1) Which one?  
line ??

2) Describe the algorithm using as many known algorithms instead of reinventing existing ones.  

3) Running time in terms of input parameters.  


# Dynamic Programming

1) Which one?  

2) Using the books notation `let OPT(...)`, denote the value of a partial solution. Give a recurrence relation for OPT including relevant boundary conditions  

3) Running time in terms of input parameters.  


# Flow

1) Which one?  

2) Explain the reduction and be precise in how the problem is converted to flow.  

3) Running time in terms of input parameters (Precise flow algorithm used).  

# NP-hard

1) Which one? (Call it `P_1`)  

2) Which other NP-hard problem can this be considered as? (`P_2`)  

3) Do you need to prove `P_1 <=p P_2` or `P_2 <=p P_1`?  

4) Describe the reduction. Both in general and a small but complete example.
