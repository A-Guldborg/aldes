# Greedy

Hmm, independent set? 

1) Which one?
minkfarms
2) Describe the algorithm, e.g. using pseudocode.
Sort the `n` farms by their number of mink increasing, and then continously remove the smallest number from `t` until deducting the next farm `m_i` will make `t <= 0`.
3) Running time in terms of input parameters.
The slowest operation will be the sorting, which can be done with multiple sorting algorithms in `O(n log n)` time.

# Graph traversal

1) Which one?
Diameter
2) Describe the algorithm using as many known algorithms instead of reinventing existing ones.
BFS from any node, take the node that is the furthest away (take the longest of the resulting paths) and run a new BFS from this node. This gives the maximum distance from the node furthest away from this node.
3) Running time in terms of input parameters.
The diameter of `G` is `O(n+m)` since we run BFS which is `O(n+m)` two times. 

# Dynamic Programming

1) Which one?
minkmassacre
2) Using the books notation `let OPT(...)`, denote the value of a partial solution. Give a recurrence relation for OPT including relevant boundary conditions  
Knapsack:
- `OPT(i, w)` such that `i <= n` and `w <= k` such that for farms `m_1 ... m_i` with a maximum of `w` minks to be slaughtered can be determined.
- `OPT(0, w)` = 0 - With no farms, we cannot kill any mink
- `OPT(i, w) = OPT(i-1, w)` when `m_i > w` since adding the new farm would exceed the limit `w` and there is no reason to include this in the solution for `OPT(i, w)`.
- `OPT(i, w) = max(OPT(i-1, w), OPT(i, w - m_i) + m_i)` - here we take either the optimal solution without the current farm or the optimal solution for the same farms but where the limit `w` allows for the current farm to be added as well (`w - m_i`).
3) Running time in terms of input parameters.
`O(n*k)`

# Flow

1) Which one?
Isolation
2) Explain the reduction and be precise in how the problem is converted to flow.
If we consider each species as a node and infection possibility `f -> t` as an edge between the two nodes `f` and `t` (directed) with a weight of 1, then we can run any flow algorithm (Let us choose Ford Fulkerson) to find the minimum cut. This gives us a set of edges that we should remove which we can do by removing one of the two species from each min-cut edge.
If the edge `virus -> loyal subjects` exists, there is no valid solution and the result will thus be `impossible`. 
3) Running time in terms of input parameters (Precise flow algorithm used).
This would give us a running time `O((T+S)*T)` since the running-time is defined as BFS (`O(T+S)`) times the number of augmenting paths, which must be at most the number of infection possibilities `T`.

# NP-hard

1) Which one?
Anti social network
2) Describe the algorithm, e.g. using pseudocode.
Count the number of friends per person, i.e. for each person `p` keep track of all friendships (`u-v`) where `n in {u, v}`.
Sort all `n` people by the number of friends decreasing, then give out a mask as long as there are any left (keeping track of number of used masks compared to `t`).
When a mask is given out, decrease all of their friends' count of friendships. This can be done since the friendship `u-v` is now "legal" iff at least one of `{u, v}` and thus their friendship can be considered legal.
3) Running time in terms of input parameters.

1) Which one? (Call it `P_1`)
2) Which other NP-hard problem can this be considered as? (`P_2`)
3) Do you need to prove `P_1 <=p P_2` or `P_2 <=p P_1`?
4) Describe the reduction. Both in general and a small but complete example. 

# Task 6

1) Counter-example:  
Best independent set has size 3: `S = {b, d, e}`. Using any arbitrary tie-breaker to choose the vertex with minimum degree can lead to choosing vertex e, f, d or b. Since choosing `f` would lead to the smaller independent set `S' = {f, a}` than `S`, Prof. Gecko's algorithm with an arbitrary tie-breaker will be insufficient.

2) Complexity argument:
